# DataQuest Projects

###### By: Nick Stanzione

Summary of the projects I completed for DataQuest's Data Scientist in Python online bootcamp. Overall, the courses and projects took a couple years to complete, but got me in the habit of coding python weekly. This course gave me the confidence to introduce python into my day job as an actuary.

#### Purpose: 
- Learn Python
- How to Use Python for Data Analysis
- Leveraging Mathematics for Data Science
- How To Use Common Python Libraries

#### Key Analysis Files:
- iOS & Andriod Apps
- Hacker News
- Exploring eBay Car Sales
- College Majors and Earnings
- College Degrees and Gender
- Employee Exit Surveys
- Home Sales Model
- Predict Bike Rentals

### Python Programs
- predict.py

###### iOS & Andriod Apps
This project goes through basic data analysis and cleaning: removing duplicates, identifying bad data, and creating frequency tables. This was the first project in the bootcamp that goes through some common syntax and data structures that will be used through out python programming: loops, arrays, dicts, etc.

###### Hacker News
Furthering analysis skills. Reviewing Hacker News data set to understand what may lead to high post engagement.

###### Exploring eBay Car Sales
Introuction to Using Pandas. Using pandas to understand data set quickly (.head(), .info(), .describe()). Averages, Frequency Counts, Filtering, Sorting, Removing N/As

###### College Majors and Earnings
Introuction to Using MatPlotLib. Basic data vizualizations.

###### College Degrees and Gender
More Advanced Use of MatPlotLib. Formatting, Subplots, Loops, Export.

###### Employee Exit Surveys
More Advanced Use of Pandas. Heavy amount of data cleaning and data analaysis.

###### Home Sales Model
Intro into ML Topics. Feature Engineering & Selection. K-Fold Cross Validation. sklearn Library.

###### Predict Bike Rentals
More Advanced ML Methods. Decision Trees and Random Forests.

###### predict.py
Side project during the course using linear regression to predict stock market.
